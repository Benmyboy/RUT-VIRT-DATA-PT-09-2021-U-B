# Data Science Bootcamp

## Class Rules

1. We LOVE questions. If you have questions, please ask! BUT, do not interrupt Leighaâ€™s lecture with them. Put your questions in the **#02-ask-the-class** channel. Either the TAs or your classmates will answer. If necessary, TAs will elevate the question for Leigha to answer after her lecture.
2. You must have all installations and configurations ready BEFORE the first day of the new unit. You will have plenty of time during the previous week to do so and get help. Instructions (if any) will be in the #05-installations channel. Questions about installations must go into the **#05-installations** channel. We will not spend class time addressing installation concerns.
3. You must have your camera on during class. If you have a reason it cannot be on, you must contact @SSM Jeanna LaBella.
