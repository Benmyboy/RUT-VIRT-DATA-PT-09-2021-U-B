# Module 6: Getting Started with APIs

## Overview

This week, we will be introducing APIS. In this unit, you will learn how to use Python to retrieve data from APIs, parse the responses, and use the data to create maps and charts.

In today's class, you will review how to use the Python request library to make requests to APIs, how to traverse JSON objects, and how to handle errors in their code.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, you will be able to:

* Obtain and store API keys in a config file
* Make API calls using the Python requests library
* Parse and traverse through JSON objects
* Handle errors by using try-except blocks
