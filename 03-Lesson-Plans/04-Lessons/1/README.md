# Module 4 Class 1: Getting Started with Pandas and Jupyter Notebook

## Overview

Introduction to an open-source distribution software called Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook, a product of Anaconda, which allows you to use Python to create documents that contain live code. Although Jupyter Notebook supports over 40 different programming languages, you will be using Python to learn the basics of the Pandas library, an open-source library that provides high-performance data analysis tools. 

In today's class, after ensuring that Anaconda is installed correctly, students will use Jupyter Notebook with Pandas to read raw data from CSV files, inspect and clean data, merge datasets, and apply their knowledge and skills of Python to perform mathematical calculations. You'll also work with lists and dictionaries, use repetition and decision statements, and apply formatting.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:
 
* Verify that they have installed Anaconda.
* Verify that they have created a working PythonData conda environment.
* Import and read a CSV into a DataFrame using Pandas
* Use a variety of Pandas methods and functions on a DataFrame
* Merge two DataFrames
* Format values in DataFrame columns
