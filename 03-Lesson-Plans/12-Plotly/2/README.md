# Module 12 Class 2: Events, D3, and GitHub Pages

## Overview

Today, the students will expand on their chart-building skills: they’ll have their webpages respond to events, they’ll retrieve data using `D3.json`, and they'll deploy their work to GitHub Pages.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Add multiple traces to their plots
* Use events to dynamically change their webpage
* Use `D3.json()` to load in data from an outside source.
* Deploy a webpage to Github Pages
