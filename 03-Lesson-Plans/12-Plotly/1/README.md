# Module 12 Class 1: Plotly Basics

## Overview

This week, we will be introducing `Plotly.js`, a JavaScript visualization library. Students will learn to use Plotly and JavaScript to create an interactive data visualization for the web.

In today's class, students will use Plotly to create basic plots. Then, they will transform their plots using the JavaScript `filter()`, `map()`, `sort()`, and `slice()` methods. Finally, they will use arrow functions to shorten the syntax of their functions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Create basic plots, including box and pie charts, with Plotly.
* Use the following JavaScript methods to transform their plots:
 * map
 * filter
 * slice
 * sort
* Create anonymous functions with the arrow function.
