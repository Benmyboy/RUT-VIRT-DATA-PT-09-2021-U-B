# Module 9 Class 1: Querying Databases with SQLAlchemy

## Overview

This week, we will be using the Python library SQLAlchemy to connect to a SQL database, retrieve data into Python objects, create a Flask API web app, and connect to the app to render data on a webpage. 

In today's class, you will use SQLAlchemy to connect to a database, inspect the table to get the table schema, write queries using SQL commands and Python, convert a SQLite table into a Pandas DataFrame, and plot results of a SQL query with Matplotlib.  

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, you will be able to:

* Connect to a SQLite database using SQLAlchemy
* Perform basic SQL queries using `engine.execute()`
* Reflect existing databases
* Use the SQLAlchemy Inspector to view table names and metadata in the SQLite file
* Plot the query results from the SQLAlchemy object relational mapper (ORM)
