# Module 5 Class 2: DataFrame Visualizations

## Overview

You will learn how to graph data from Pandas DataFrames after performing data munging operations to modify columns, remove missing data, fill in missing data, and group data into similar records to get sums and averages.

The main focus of today's class is graphing data from DataFrames. Today’s activities requires you to perform data munging tasks such as using `value_counts()`, `groupby()` with `count()`, `mean()`, and `sum()`, and the `loc[]` method to filter data before you create charts. You will also be introduced to the `pivot()` and `resample()` functions, which will help you with the Challenge. The `resample()` function can order the time series data by hour, day, week, month, or year depending on the desired output to showcase the data in a chart.  

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, you will be able to:

* Create line, bar, pie, and scatter charts from Pandas DataFrames
* Add and modify chart features
