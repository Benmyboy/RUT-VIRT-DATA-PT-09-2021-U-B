# Module 5 Class 1: Getting Started with Matplotlib and Visualizations

## Overview

This week, you will be introduced to Matplotlib, a Python plotting library used to produce publication-quality data visualizations. Matplotlib has a set of features for creating and annotating charts that visualize data in a Data Series or DataFrame. You will use Matplotlib to create line, bar, scatter, bubble, pie, and box-and-whisker charts, and also to make them visually compelling and informative by adding titles, axes labels, legends, and custom colors.  You'll also be introduced to SciPy, a statistical Python package, and NumPy, a fundamental package for scientific computing, to perform summary statistics. 

The main focus of today's class is to get you comfortable with creating and annotating line, bar, pie, and scatter charts. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, you will be able to:
 
* Create line, bar, pie, and scatter charts
* Add and modify chart features
