# Module 10 Class 1: Mission to Mars - Web Scraping with HTML/CSS

## Overview

This week, we will be introducing web scraping. In this unit, you will first learn the basic setup of webpages with HTML and CSS and how to use Beautiful Soup to navigate the HTML in order to scrape out the contents that they want. Then we will expand on this skill by using the Splinter library to automate the process and store their results in a Mongo database.

In today's class, you will need to make sure that the web-driver manager is installed into your virtual environments. You can do so by running `pip install webdriver_manager` in your environment.

* Read HTML
