# Module 11 Class 2: JavaScript Objects and DOM Manipulation

## Overview

We will delve further into JavaScript as they learn to perform more sophisticated operations and data manipulation and then learn how to manipulate the HTML DOM with `D3.js`. 

The main areas of focus for today's class are to have everybody access, create, update, and iterate over JavaScript objects, use JavaScript to populate and filter data structures based on user input, and apply these changes to a webpage using the `D3.js` library to dynamically manipulate DOM elements.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, you will be able to:

* Use `forEach()` and callback functions
