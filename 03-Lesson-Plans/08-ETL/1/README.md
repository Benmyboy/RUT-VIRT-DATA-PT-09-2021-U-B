# Module 8 Class 1: Extract, Transform, Load

## Overview

This week, we will be introducing the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process. In this unit, you will learn to use Python functions, list comprehensions, and regular expressions, as well as how to move data through a pipeline.

In today's class, you will learn about Python functions and more advanced lambda functions. They will then learn how to create lists from list comprehensions before getting an introduction to regular expressions (RegEx).

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, you will be able to:

* Create functions to avoid repeated code.
* Create lambda functions and use them to replace regular functions.
* Expand on list comprehensions by adding in conditional statements.
* Use basic regular expressions to pull apart certain text.
