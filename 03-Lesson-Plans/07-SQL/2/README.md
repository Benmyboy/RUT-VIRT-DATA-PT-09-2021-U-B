# Module 7 Class 2: Filtering with Joins

## Overview

We will dive deeper into queries with aggregates, grouping, and ordering. 

The main focus of today's class is performing more complex SQL queries that use joins with `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses, that are filtered with the `WHERE` clause, and that apply aggregate functions to group records and filtered tables. You will also be introduced to the `DISTINCT ON` clause, which will help you with the Challenge. The `DISTINCT ON` clause will return non-duplicate or distinct values from a SQL query.  

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, you will be able to:

* Perform SQL queries using `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY`
* Perform SQL queries using aggregate functions 
* Perform SQL queries using multiple joins to filter data
