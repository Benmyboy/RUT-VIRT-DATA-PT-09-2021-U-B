# Module 15 Class 1: The Fundamentals of R

## Overview

This week, we will be introducing the programming language R. In this unit, students will use R to perform data analysis, just like they did with Python and Pandas; additionally, they’ll use R to perform statistical analysis. 

In today's class, students will make sure R is installed correctly, then they'll review the basics of the R programming language, create vectors, use `for` loops, use `if-else` statements, identify substrings of strings, create functions, and organize data into tibbles &mdash; R’s version of data frames.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Verify that R and RStudio are installed correctly
* Understand the fundamentals of R programming
* Understand how to use RStudio
* Learn how to create and manipulate data in tibbles
* Compare and contrast the features of Python and R
