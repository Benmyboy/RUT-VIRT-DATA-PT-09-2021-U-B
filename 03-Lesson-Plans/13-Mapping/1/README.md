# Module 13 Class 1: Creating Maps with Leaflet

## Overview

This week, we will be introducing the JavaScript library Leaflet. In this unit, students will use JavaScript and the `D3.js` library to retrieve coordinates from GeoJSON data and use the Leaflet library to plot geographical data on a Mapbox map through an API request.

In today's class, students will learn to render geographical maps and add interactive elements, including markers and circle markers that have varying radii based on the data. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Use the Leaflet library with a Mapbox API key to create geographical maps
* Use the Leaflet library to add markers to a map 
* Iterate through an array using JavaScript, and add data to a map 
* Use layers and layer controls to add interactivity to maps
